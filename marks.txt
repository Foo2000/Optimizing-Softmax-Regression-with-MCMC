Final Project Marks
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Clear description of your problem: 5/5

Approach to your problem: 10/10
---Nice move discarding the correlated features in the galaxy classification task

Technical execution: 25/25

Documentation and testing: 3/5
---Fantastic documentation, but no evidence of code testing.

Presentation of results: 4/5
---Corner plot was basically unreadable given how tiny the axes were!

Interpretation of results: 7/10
---The corner plot contains incredible richness, with interesting degeneracies
to explore. These should've been discussed and interpreted!

Creativity + critical thinking: 8/10
---Good critical comparison of the relative merits of the two approaches:
good idea to consider not just the performance but the timing
---Would've been good to have examined some of the incorrect classifications to see if it's possible to get some intuition for what went wrong.

Overall communication: 4/5
---Include some pictures showing samples of the datasets!

TOTAL: 66/75
