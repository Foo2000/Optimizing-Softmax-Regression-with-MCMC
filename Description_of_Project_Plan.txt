We plan to implement a parameter optimizing method based on the Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to optimize the parameters of a Softmax Regression model. We plan to investigate the performance of our method on two multi-class classification tasks. We also plan to compare the performance of this method to the performance of optimizing the same model with Gradient Descent. We expect that optimizing the model with both methods will produce comparable accuracies. We also expect that the Gradient Descent method will be much faster, while the MCMC method will be able to produce error bars for the results. We plan to visualize the optimizing process of the MCMC method by plotting the log-likelihood evolved with the MCMC steps and making a corner plot for the posterior distribution.
