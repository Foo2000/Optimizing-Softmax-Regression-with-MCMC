# Optimizing-Softmax-Regression-with-MCMC

In this project, we performed Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to optimize the parameters of a Softmax Regression model. We tested our method on two multi-class classification tasks and compared the performance of this method to that of a Gradient Descent.
