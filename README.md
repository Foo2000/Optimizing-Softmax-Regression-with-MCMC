# Optimizing-Softmax-Regression-with-MCMC

Description: In this project, we implemented a parameter optimizing method based on the Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to optimize the parameters of a Softmax Regression model. We investigated the performance of our method on two multi-class classification tasks. We also compared the performance of this method to the performance of optimizing the same model with Gradient Descent.

The one-paragraph description of the project plan is above.

The analysis code is in Optimizing_Softmax_Regression_with_MCMC.ipynb.

The final paper is in Report.pdf.
